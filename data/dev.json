Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.\n\nA future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\n\nThe work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \"In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.\"\n\nNIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919. The samples, preserved in paraffin blocks, were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation. Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage \"ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe, acute, secondary bacterial pneumonia,\" says Dr. Taubenberger. In most cases, he adds",

Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1\u20136).\u2020 Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26\u2013October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC\u2019s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015\u20132019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25\u201344 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limi",

                        "answer": "Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\n\nAlthough more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25\u201344 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%\u201336.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere (7), but these ranges might not refl",

Michelle Luhan Grisham (D) imposed a ban on gatherings of five or more that excludes those \"congregated in a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of worship.\"",

For an average healthy person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring, because they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely.\n\nWhile it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks.",

                        "answer": "Doctors typically refer to two distinct forms of oxygen deprivation: anoxic brain injuries occur when the brain is totally deprived of oxygen due to sudden cardiac arrest, choking, strangulation, and other sudden injuries. Hypoxic brain injuries occur when the brain receives less oxygen than it needs, but is not completely deprived of oxygen. Because the effects of the two injuries are similar, many brain experts use the terms interchangeably.\n\nA few seconds of oxygen deprivation won't cause lasting harm, so a child who holds his breath in frustration, a combatant choked unconscious during a Jiu-Jitsu match, and a diver who needs a few extra seconds to come up for air are unlikely to experience brain damage. The precise timeline of anoxic brain injuries depends on a number of personal idiosyncrasies, including overall brain and cardiovascular health, as well as the level of blood oxygenation at the time of injury. Generally speaking, injuries begin at the one-minute mark, steadily worsening thereafter.\nHow Long Can the Brain Go Without Oxygen? A Timeline\n\n    Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness.\n    At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying.\n    At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely.\n    At five minutes, death becomes imminent.\n    At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable.\n    At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder, Aleix Segura held his breath for 24 minutes and 3 seconds without sustaining brain damage!",

What are the five major challenges Buhari is facing? An overview. 1. Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram\n\nHe promised to defeat the islamist terror group Boko Haram. Since his election in March 2015, Buhari has been able to curb the influence of the Islamist extremists. But although the president in December 2015 said that Boko Haram was \"technically defeated,\" the islamists continue to attack. The terrorist group is said to be responsible for an attack in Maiduguri on Wednesday that left eight people dead.\n\nStill unclear is under what circumstances the 21 Chibok schoolgirls were released on Thursday. According to local sources, the girls were swapped for Boko Haram prisoners. The Nigerian government has denied this. Over two years ago, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from Chibok. The Chibok girls became a symbol of the Boko Haram terror. Although the Nigerian military was able to claw back territory from from Boko Haram, Buhari has been under criticism, because he wasn't - until this week - able to free any of the girls.\n\nAnd in the northeastern part of the country, the population still faces a humanitarian crisis because of Boko Haram. UNICEF workers are referring to the worst situation of hunger in the world. More than three million people in the region have been forced out of their homes. Aid agencies can only reach many of the refugee camps by helicopter -\u00a0the streets are very insecure. Oxfam workers accuse the army of doing nothing in the region instead of securing access roads for aid agencies. 2. Economic slump\n\nThe fight against Boko Haram is costing Buhari a lot of money and it is running out. The price of oil has gone down by half since mid 2014, likewise oil production has sunk drastically due to sabotage by rebels in the Niger Delta -\u00a0Buhari's next problem. Although Nigeria is the eighth largest oil produ",

The signature can then be compared with the voter\u2019s signature on file, usually from a voter registration form.\n\nEight states also require a witness signature, while three states require notarization, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Alabama has perhaps the strictest rules, directing voters to submit copies of their IDs as well as signatures from either a notary or two witnesses.\n\nThe return envelopes are typically opened by a different group of workers from those who scan the ballots. Outside observers, often appointed by a political party or campaign, are allowed to monitor post-election procedures, such as ballot counting. All but four states - North Carolina, Kansas, Maine and Florida - explicitly permit partisan observers to watch some post-election processes, according to the NCSL.\n\nIn addition, ballots vary widely in appearance - not just from state to state but also from county to county and even from town to town, because most voters are not just making a choice for U.S. president but also for local offices. Any ballot that does not match the proper form will be rejected by election officials.\n\nMany jurisdictions use bar codes on ballot envelopes that can be used to help with ballot processing, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a public policy institute. The bar codes also allow voters to track their ballots to ensure they have been received.",

In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter   and those are caught. There are security checks that should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud. However, signature matching is not an exact science, both in terms of qualifying votes that should be counted and votes that shouldn\u2019t be counted. But I do believe that processes in place are strong attempts to assure the security of the system.\u201d\n\nDr. Hood agrees:\u00a0\u201cIt really depends on the state - the United States basically has 50 different election systems with different safeguards. North Carolina has what they call witness affirmation   someone has to sign witnessing that the person sending the ballot voted the ballot.

Incident rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent. \n\nA study published by a Columbia University political scientist tracked incidence rates for voter fraud for two years, and found that the rare fraud reported could be traced to \u201cfalse claims by the loser of a close race, mischief and administrative or voter error.\u201d\n\nA 2017 analysis published in The Washington Post concluded that there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to vote.\n\nA comprehensive 2014 study published in The Washington Post found 31 credible instances of impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.",

Imagine what would have happened if 1.5 million ballots were simply mailed out to all of those individuals to addresses where they no longer live.\n\nBallots are a valuable commodity. How many would have been voted anyway by fraudsters or vote harvesters collecting absentee ballots in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJust look at what happened in North Carolina in 2018 in the 9th Congressional District race, in which the result was overturned by the state election board because of illegal vote harvesting that included altering and forging absentee ballots.\n\nAll-mail jurisdictions such as Oregon like to brag about the supposed \u201csecurity\u201d of their systems, which consists of almost nothing other than a rapid, superficial signature comparison.\u00a0\n\nAs Melody Rose, an assistant professor of political science at Portland State University, told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times: \u201cI don\u2019t have much faith in that process. I can forge my husband\u2019s signature perfectly.\u201d\n\nRose conducted a survey of one county, Washington County, outside Portland. Five percent of registered voters admitted that other people marked their ballots, and 2.4% said someone else signed their ballots.",

                        "answer": "States have multiple tools to address valid security concerns and protect election integrity when it comes to mail ballots. And recent technologies and strategies have significantly enhanced the security of mail balloting.\n\nIdentity verification: The principal method used to detect and prevent fraud is the mail ballot envelope itself, where each voter must include personal identifying information (such as address, birthday, and driver\u2019s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number). In most states, that information includes a signature to match\u00a0against the voter rolls. \n\nBar codes: Most election jurisdictions now use some form of bar code on their ballot envelopes. These bar codes allow election officials to keep track of ballot processing and help voters know whether their ballot has been received. Bar codes also allow states to identify and eliminate duplicate ballots.\n\nBallot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service: In many jurisdictions, including California, Colorado and Florida, ballot envelopes are equipped with intelligent mail bar codes to track an envelope from drop-off to delivery and processing. \n\nSecure drop-off locations and drop boxes: Multiple ballot return options limit the opportunity for ballot tampering by fostering voter independence in returning a ballot.\n\nHarsh penalties: Anyone who commits voter fraud using a mail ballot risks severe criminal and civil penalties: up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for each act of fraud under federal law, in addition to any state penalties.\n\nPostelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.\n\nPolling sites as a fail-safe: if there are concerns that an eligible voter\u2019s mail ballots could be lost or uncounted, in-person polling sites provided.",

In 1996, she joined the majority in United States v. Virginia, ruling that the state could not continue to operate an all-male educational institution (the Virginia Military Institute) with taxpayer dollars. She also joined in the majority opinion in Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), striking down a Nebraska law banning so-called \u201cpartial birth\u201d abortions. She dissented vehemently in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire (2007), in which an Alabama woman sued unsuccessfully for back pay to compensate for the years in which she had been paid substantially less than junior male colleagues performing the same job. The U.S. Congress would later address the issue of pay equity through legislation known as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.",

Decider was there in Park City for the screening, and our Senior Film Reporter Anna Menta filed a review of Cuties, calling it a \u201ccoming-of-age film that will speak volumes to anyone who has lived through the agonizingly confusing time that is girlhood.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Netflix announced the premiere date of Cuties (September 9) and released the trailer for the film, which immediately set off a firestorm of criticism from hordes of angry keyboard warriors \u2014most of whom, we assume, have yet to actually see the movie\u2014 who found some fresh ammunition for the culture wars.

That language read:\n\n    Amy, 11, becomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew. Hoping to join them, she starts to explore her femininity, defying her family\u2019s traditions.\n\nEver since Miley Cyrus set the world aflame in 2013 by bringing the twerking dance craze into the mainstream \u2014 putting \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d directly into the crosshairs of the outrage economy on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 the word \u201ctwerking\u201d has been a loaded term. Combining that term with the precocious age of the film\u2019s primary protagonist, an 11-year-old girl, left the rabid (and scarily thriving) QAnon community foaming at the mouth; it was the cultural equivalent of throwing red meat to Joe Exotic\u2019s menagerie of underfed tigers. The movie\u2019s TV-MA rating further incited Twitter users to accuse Netflix of making \u201cchild porn,\u201d of being run \u201cby a bunch of pedophiles,\u201d and much worse.

Just last month, an edition featured a cartoon of the Virgin Mary, spread-eagled, giving birth to Jesus.",

Smoke particles are fairly large and are better at scattering the longer (red) wavelengths of light, known as Mie scattering. If there a sufficient amount of smoke, Mie scattering will dominate over Rayleigh scattering, which is how light is primarily scattered in the atmosphere. This causes the red and orange colored sky.",

The campaign over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of \u201cdemographic genocide.\u201d\n\nThe state regularly subjects minority women to pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands, the interviews and data show. Even while the use of IUDs and sterilization has fallen nationwide, it is rising sharply in Xinjiang.\n\nThe population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply. Having too many children is a major reason people are sent to detention camps, the AP found, with the parents of three or more ripped away from their families unless they can pay huge fines. Police raid homes, terrifying parents as they search for hidden children.",

Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates continue to plummet, falling nearly 24% last year alone \u2014 compared to just 4.2% nationwide, statistics show. - Latest figures for the year 2018 show that for Hotan & Kashgar prefectures, birth rates are 8.17 per 1000 population, compared to 10.69 per 1000 for the entire Xinjiang region, and 10.94 per 1000 nationally.

                        "answer": "Sterilizations, iuds, and mandatory birth control: the ccp\u2019s campaign to suppress uyghur birthrates in xinjiang:\n\nNatural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically; growth rates fell by 84 percent in the two largest Uyghur prefectures between 2015 and 2018, and declined further in several minority regions in 2019. For 2020, one Uyghur region set an unprecedented near-zero birth rate target: a mere 1.05 per mille, compared to 19.66 per mille in 2018. This was intended to be achieved through \u201cfamily planning work.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, natural population growth plummeted: to 4.06\u2030 in all minority regions and 2.58\u2030 in Kashgar and\nHotan. - In a drastic reversal of long-standing historic trends, the declines in Uyghur population growth have occurred mainly in the countryside. For example, Keriya County in Hotan had one of Xinjiang\u2019s highest natural population growth rates in previous years, with rates being nearly double those of Hotan City. Its first marked decline occurred in 2016, but the by far most dramatic drop (to -0.49\u2030) took place in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, minority regions in Xinjiang also deployed mass health exams to identify family planning violations. Campaigns such as \u201ctesting all who need to be tested\u201d (\u4f53\u68c0\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e94\u68c0\u5c3d\u68c0, tijian shixian ying jian jin yian) were associated with curbing such violations (Yining City, January 22, 2019). \u201cZero birth control violation incidents\u201d (\u8fdd\u6cd5\u751f\u80b2\u96f6\u53d1\u751f, weifa shengyu ling fasheng), a term that was not routinely used elsewhere in the PRC nor in Xinjiang prior to 2018, became a standard family planning target in 2018 and 2019. A particularly strict case here is Hotan Prefecture, a region with a population of 2.53 million, which in 2019 planned to have no more than exactly 21 birth control policy violations. According to\nZhaosu County\u2019s family planning work report, \u201czero\u201d violations meant that all involved government units on\nall levels had to sign solemn pledges promising to achieve that goal.",

A judge has discretion whether or not to place the defendant on the sex offender registry. By contrast, if the sexual act is oral sex, anal sex or digital penetration, the court must place the defendant on the sex offender registry regardless of the facts of the crime and even in cases where the prosecutor does not want to place the defendant on the registry. This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth.",

The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close (such as 17-year-old and 18-year-old couple).

Sanctuaries, zoos and parks were safe havens for these special animals and helped to sustain and increase their population size. The first national preserve for bison was founded in 1907 near Cache, OK and later became the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nYears later, hunting laws and other protective measures allowed the remaining bison to live, thrive and multiply. Today their numbers have rebounded to around 350,000\u2014about 1% of their original herd size\u2014but enough to keep them out of the dangers of extinction.",

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to stabilize all low-income individuals with life-threatening conditions, and Emergency Medicaid covers emergency services for immigrants who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid but for their immigration status. Thus, undocumented patients often receive care much later in the course of diseases, as documented in a study of New York City public hospitals. Often, individuals return repeatedly to emergency departments for the same condition. By delaying needed care, undocumented persons face serious, more costly, health conditions in the long term.
