The plan calls for a restructuring of Medicaid that would likely lead to reduced coverage and benefits. The budget also reduces future Medicare spending, but that mainly affects health care providers, not beneficiaries.\n\nIt’s misleading to say that the health care changes pay for tax cuts to billionaires, because there isn’t a direct link between them. It’s also worth noting that while in the long-run the tax cuts remain in place for higher earning individuals, every income group on average is expected to pay less in taxes in 2019 because of the tax law.\n\nCastro’s statement is partially accurate.

The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it\nwas viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI\nsupplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 sup-\nplement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings.\nFurthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the dis-\ntribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical\nunemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies\nthat most workers have replacement rates above 100%."

Sickle cell is a genetic condition, which means it is passed on from your parents and you are born with it; you cannot catch it from other people.\n\nSickle cell disorders causes your normally round and flexible blood cells to become stiff and sickle shaped, stopping the blood cells, and the oxygen they carry, from being able to move freely around the body and causing pain. This can cause  episodes of severe pain. These painful episodes are referred to as sickle cell crisis. They are treated with strong painkillers such as morphine to control the pain."

Phil Murphy on Friday signed an executive order for the Nov. 3 elections to be conducted in a hybrid but mostly mail-in fashion in the Garden State amid the coronavirus pandemic. All of the state’s active registered voters will automatically receive ballots in the mail, though there will still be some in-person polling locations across the state where people can cast a paper provisional ballot.\n\nMurphy said you can put your ballot in the mail, drop it in one of several secure boxes to be set up across the state, bring it to polling location on Election Day, or vote provisionally in person.\n\nThis comes despite extreme opposition to widespread mail-in voting from President Donald Trump, as well as from other Republicans and some county officials in New Jersey, who warn about the potential for voter fraud.

Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected.\n\nAnd there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" - “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said."

A total of 24 states now allow mail-in voting for any reason including fear of the coronavirus, compared with 16 in 2016. The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020.\n\n“It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”\nTo understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. \n\nDr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \n\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.”"

An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected."

In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter   and those are caught. There are security checks that should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud. However, signature matching is not an exact science, both in terms of qualifying votes that should be counted and votes that shouldn’t be counted. But I do believe that processes in place are strong attempts to assure the security of the system.”\n\nDr. Hood agrees: “It really depends on the state - the United States basically has 50 different election systems with different safeguards. North Carolina has what they call witness affirmation   someone has to sign witnessing that the person sending the ballot voted the ballot. Another safeguard is if the state -- like Georgia -- requires voters to request absentee ballots. This way, the voter is initiating the process.”"

Imagine what would have happened if 1.5 million ballots were simply mailed out to all of those individuals to addresses where they no longer live.\n\nBallots are a valuable commodity. How many would have been voted anyway by fraudsters or vote harvesters collecting absentee ballots in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles?  \n\nJust look at what happened in North Carolina in 2018 in the 9th Congressional District race, in which the result was overturned by the state election board because of illegal vote harvesting that included altering and forging absentee ballots.\n\nAll-mail jurisdictions such as Oregon like to brag about the supposed “security” of their systems, which consists of almost nothing other than a rapid, superficial signature comparison. \n\nAs Melody Rose, an assistant professor of political science at Portland State University, told the Los Angeles Times: “I don’t have much faith in that process. I can forge my husband’s signature perfectly.”\n\nRose conducted a survey of one county, Washington County, outside Portland. Five percent of registered voters admitted that other people marked their ballots, and 2.4% said someone else signed their ballots."

And recent technologies and strategies have significantly enhanced the security of mail balloting.\n\nIdentity verification: The principal method used to detect and prevent fraud is the mail ballot envelope itself, where each voter must include personal identifying information (such as address, birthday, and driver’s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number). In most states, that information includes a signature to match against the voter rolls. \n\nBar codes: Most election jurisdictions now use some form of bar code on their ballot envelopes. These bar codes allow election officials to keep track of ballot processing and help voters know whether their ballot has been received. Bar codes also allow states to identify and eliminate duplicate ballots.\n\nBallot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service: In many jurisdictions, including California, Colorado and Florida, ballot envelopes are equipped with intelligent mail bar codes to track an envelope from drop-off to delivery and processing. \n\nSecure drop-off locations and drop boxes: Multiple ballot return options limit the opportunity for ballot tampering by fostering voter independence in returning a ballot.\n\nHarsh penalties: Anyone who commits voter fraud using a mail ballot risks severe criminal and civil penalties: up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for each act of fraud under federal law, in addition to any state penalties.\n\nPostelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.\n\nPolling sites as a fail-safe: if there are concerns that an eligible voter’s mail ballots could be lost or uncounted, in-person polling sites provided."

So, as of now, everything stands uncertain. \n\nMeanwhile, post the reports of $500 Million divorce with Portia de Rossi, recently Ellen DeGeneres was in the news due to death hoax. While the news shocked several admirers of Ellen, a lot of people tweeted using that hashtag to share memes and jokes on her.\nThe production team of Ellen DeGeneres’ show had clearly denied the shutting of The Ellen Show.
